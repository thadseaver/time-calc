# Time-Calc #


Calculates the amount of time that has passed between the start and end time entered by the user.

## Description ##

Enter the start time, end time, and whether break and/or lunch was taken between the start and end time.

* Break time will reduce the total time by 15 minutes
* Lunch time will reduce the total time by 30 minutes

## Background ##
One of my co-workers is required to log how much time it takes to perform certain tasks. Making this calculator sounded like a fun project and it makes my co-worker's job easier. Win-win!

## Considerations ##
This project was created for a very specific purpose.

* It will be used by only one person
* The user works day shift so there is no concern for times that span multiple days
* The user's workstation has a touch screen monitor
* The user has large hands
